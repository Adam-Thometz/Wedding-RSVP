          In numerology, 22 is considered to be a master number, a symbol of creativity and power. Letâ€™s celebrate as if the Great Depression hasn't happened yet! Put on your glad rags and sparkly outfits to celebrate the marriage of Melody and Adam with a roaring 20s themed cocktail wedding reception! Our ceremony will be private - only parents, siblings, and a bestman and maid of honor from each side will be in attendence - but the reception is open to all of you (and your dates)!
