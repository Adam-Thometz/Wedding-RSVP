          In numerology, 22 is considered to be a master number, a symbol of creativity and power. Let’s celebrate as if the Great Depression hasn't happened yet! Put on your glad rags and sparkly outfits to celebrate the marriage of Melody and Adam with a roaring 20’s themed cocktail wedding reception! We will have our ceremony in a garden (or at a hall, depending on the weather) and have the reception immediately after!
